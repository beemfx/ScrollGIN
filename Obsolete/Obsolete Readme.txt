This folder contains all obsolete scrollgin materials.

At the time I wrote this the following obsolete applications are available.

---
OLDLIBRARY.ZIP contains my old Image Library program.  This was specifically desgined for making tile librarys and is superceded by ImageEdit.

---
ScrollEdit Before IL2.zip contains a version of scrolledit that uses Tile Library rather than ImageLib.dll
