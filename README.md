# Obsolete Stuff

This branch contains all obsolete scrollgin materials.

At the time I wrote this the following obsolete applications are available.

### OLDLIBRARY.ZIP
Contains my old Image Library program.  This was specifically desgined for making tile librarys and is superceded by ImageEdit.

### ScrollEdit Before IL2.zip
Contains a version of scrolledit that uses Tile Library rather than ImageLib.dll.
